# ðŸ§  Tic-Tac-Toe Neural Agent (Pure NumPy + Tkinter)

A from-scratch neural network that learns perfect Tic-Tac-Toe play via minimax-generated training data, implemented entirely with **NumPy**.
Includes a **Tkinter-based GUI** for an interactive human vs AI gameplay experience.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

* **Pure NumPy neural network** (no external ML frameworks)
* **Forward & backward propagation** implemented manually
* **Trained on perfect-move dataset** generated using minimax algorithm
* **Tkinter GUI** with clickable grid for real-time play
* AI plays optimally â€” hard to beat, always blocks losing moves

## ðŸ›  Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ Dataset_and_HelperFunction.py   # Dataset generation & helper functions
â”œâ”€â”€ Numpy_Neural_net.py              # Neural network architecture & training logic
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                          # Tkinter GUI game loop
â”œâ”€â”€ train.py                         # Model training script

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

1. **Board Representation:**

   * 9 inputs: `1` for player, `-1` for opponent, `0` for empty.
2. **Neural Network Output:**

   * 9 values (one per cell) â†’ AI chooses highest-scoring valid move.
3. **Training:**

   * Dataset of optimal moves generated with minimax algorithm.
   * Trained using gradient descent and manual backpropagation.
4. **Gameplay:**

   * User plays as `X`, AI as `O`.
   * GUI updates in real time and announces results.

If you want, I can also make a **GIF of your Tkinter gameplay** so it looks more engaging on GitHub. That usually helps people instantly see what the project does.
Do you want me to prepare that?
